## How to run the unit tests

for unit tests to work properly you should run them inside the docker container holding the 
backend using this command

```
npm run testall
```

## Run full cycle locally

- to make you backend locally public you need to install a tool called ngrok
which you can dowload from [here](https://ngrok.com/download)

- make sure that you have run the docker compose command above to initiate the server it will open on port 3000

- just make that command to make your server public 

```
ngrok http 3000
```

this will make ngrok makes your localhost public and provide you with 2 urls an http and https when you run the command above the urls will appear take the https url copy it.
